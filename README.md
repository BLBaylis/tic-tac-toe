Brad's Tic Tac Toe v2 documentation

This is personal project is a React port of my initial Tic Tac Toe project.  It's main features are:

- The computer is unbeatable on 3 x 3, and now additionally on 5 x 5 and 7 x 7 grids.

- The option to choose who takes the first move.

- A variety of icons for both player and computer, each available in a range of colours.

Have fun!
